        text: 'The creation of Card Party was partially the result of the stay at home order because of COVID-19, however long before the pandemic I missed the card nights and parties my family would have growing up. With my parents an hour away, and my sister on the other side of the country, our card nights were getting fewer and further between. I wanted that to change especially with an impending move of my own, so Card Party was born.'
